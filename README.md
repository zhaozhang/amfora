AMFORA
======

AMFORA is a POSIX-compatible parallel scripting framework that lets users run existing programs in parallel with data stored in RAM on distributed platforms: e.g. clouds, clusters, supercomputers. 

AMFORA runs on: IBM Blue Gene/P with ZeptoOS, UChicago CS Cluster with Ubuntu 12.04, AMAZON EC2 with Ubuntu 12.04, Google Compute Engine with Debian-7-wheezy.

AMFORA features:

1. AMFORA lets the user select the scripting language they will use as the programming interface

2. AMFORA can execute LINUX command lines in parallel and cache the data in RAM

3. AMFORA provides a shared file system across the RAM on multiple nodes

4. AMFORA lets users collectively manage data movement at large scale

5. AMFORA implements the multi-read single-write consistency
